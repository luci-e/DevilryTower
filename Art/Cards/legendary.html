<div class="item-description">
uses: Infinity ticks: 1 slots: 2 class: ['Bard'] The sound of this instrument is too in tune: anyone in a 3 hexes radius area gets 4 sound damage. Alternatively, you can play a song from the following list, as a 1 tick action.
Killer queen: deals 3 sound damage to the two closest enemies (you choose in case of ambiguity) and your allies in a 2 hexes radius get 2 additional magic damage in their next attack.
Crazy diamond: restores 5 HPs to you and 3 HPs to your allies within 2 hexes.
Bites the dust: the two closest enemies cannot move for 2 ticks and allies within 2 hexes can move 1 additional hex per tick for the same duration.
Cooldown of 10 ticks. Perfectly tuned harp counts as an instrument for a Bard. Occupy 1 slot in the backpack.<br>Allegrissimo!<br></div>

Both tiles chosen are on the floor: entering a portal makes you appear in the tile adjacent to the second portal following the same direction you approached the first.
One tile is on the floor and the other on the ceiling: entering a portal on the floor makes you fall from the ceiling taking 2 damage and spending the next tick stunned. A loop is definitely an option.
Both tiles chosen are on the ceiling: Nonsense! Unless you can fly or revert gravity… then look at the first case.<br>First you will be baked, and then there will be cake.<br></div>
